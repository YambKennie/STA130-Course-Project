    "# Project Proposal: Analyzing Social Connections and Well-being\n",

    "\n",
    "## Analysis 1: Impact of Social Connections on Mental Health\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "How do the frequency and quality of social interactions influence mental health outcomes, such as feelings of loneliness and well-being?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Independent Variables**: \n",
    "  - Frequency of social interactions (e.g., `CONNECTION_social_days_classmates_p7d`, `CONNECTION_num_friends`)\n",
    "  - Quality of social interactions (e.g., `CONNECTION_benefits_new_people_happier`, `CONNECTION_preferred_frequency_one_on_one`)\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable**: \n",
    "  - Mental health outcomes (e.g., `PSYCH_positive_and_negative_affect_scale`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration\n",
    "I will use summary statistics and visualizations such as scatter plots to illustrate relationships and correlations. I could also use a box plot to compare mental health outcomes across different levels of social interaction frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "I plan to conduct a correlation analysis to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between social interactions and mental health outcomes, using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Assumptions include the linearity of relationships and normality of the variables involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "I hypothesize that higher frequencies of social interactions will correlate with lower feelings of loneliness and improved mental health outcomes, indicating the importance of social connections for well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis 2: Barriers to Social Interaction\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "What barriers prevent individuals from engaging in social activities, and how do these barriers relate to feelings of isolation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Independent Variables**: \n",
    "  - Barriers to socialization (e.g., `CONNECTION_social_barriers_afraid`, `CONNECTION_social_barriers_too_busy`)\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable**: \n",
    "  - Feelings of isolation (e.g., `LONELY_chronic_loneliness`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration\n",
    "Summary statistics and bar charts will be used to illustrate the prevalence of various barriers among respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "I may perform a regression analysis to assess the impact of identified barriers on reported feelings of isolation. Assumptions will include the linearity of the relationship and the independence of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "I hypothesize that specific barriers will significantly predict feelings of isolation, with greater barriers associated with higher levels of reported loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis 3: Community Engagement and Well-being\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "How does community involvement affect individual well-being and social connectedness?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Independent Variables**: \n",
    "  - Community involvement (e.g., `CONNECTION_community_involvement_union_p3m`, `CONNECTION_community_involvement_service_p3m`)\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable**: \n",
    "  - Well-being measures (e.g., `WELLNESS_maslach_burnout_emotionally_exhausted`, `WELLNESS_satisfied_single`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration\n",
    "Visualizations such as pie charts to display the types of community involvement and line graphs to track changes in well-being across different involvement levels will be utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "I will conduct a comparative analysis to compare well-being scores across various levels of community involvement, using ANOVA tests. Assumptions will include homogeneity of variances and normal distribution of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "I hypothesize that increased community involvement will correlate with higher well-being scores, suggesting that active participation in community life enhances individual satisfaction and emotional health.\n",
